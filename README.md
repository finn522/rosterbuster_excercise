## Rosterbuster Excercise
This is an excercise made by Simon de Bakker commissioned by CAE. The application has been made in React & Next.js. This Readme will contain the steps to get the project running and also any marks any deviations from the stated excercise.
***
### To get the application running:
1. Run `yarn install` (or `npm install`) to install all required node_modules.
2. Run `yarn build` (or `npm run build`) to make a production ready build.
3. Run `yarn start` (or `npm run start`) to view the application on http://localhost:3000.
4. Switch to responsive mobile view for the best experience.

### Deviations/complications:
- Strict Cors policies were enabled on the server, so the retrieving of new data is blocked, but should work theoretically. 
- Most English text has been changed to Dutch for consistency.
- Uncertain what info/icons should've been used for the Off and Positioning items, so creative liberty has been taken in those cases.
